# <a name="intro"></a>Introduction
This project was created for CSE 416 - Software Engineering Class in Stony Brook University. This project was created by a team of five group members. We took inspirations from Fiverr and Patreon and combined it with Algorand, a popular Cryptocurrency. This project was implemented via Django's web framework and the blockchain was a private blockchain running on Docker. 

# <a name="how"></a>How is This Project Ran
This project is hosted in a Virtual Machine. NGINX web server and WSGI is used to forward the request to the Django web application, then the response is sent back to the client by the WSGI server.
